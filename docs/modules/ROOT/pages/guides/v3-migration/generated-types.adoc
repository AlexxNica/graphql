= Type Changes

Some automatically generated types have changed to improve consistency.
These should not require any changes from the developer in most cases, unless in cases where types names are directly used.

=== OnCreate Node Types
Input types for `onCreate` in `connectOrCreate` mutations no longer accept relation fields.

=== Non Nullable Aggregation Results
Aggregation results may now be non-nullable for required fields, yielding more accurate types.

For example, for the following types:
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type User {
    name: String!
    lastName: String
}
----

Will yield different types for aggregations over `name` and `lastName`:
[source, graphql, indent=0]
----
type UserAggregateSelection {
  count: Int!
  name: StringAggregateSelectionNonNullable!
  lastName: StringAggregateSelectionNullable!
}
----

=== ConnectionWhere types renamed
`ConnectionWhere` types renamed to improve consistency with other similarly named types.
